# pnpm.fish

### Install

```sh
fisher install dangh/pnpm.fish
```

### What is it for?

1. Use the self-installer to install/update to the latest version of pnpm. It is [faster](https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/6447#issuecomment-1518446417) than installing from npmjs.

2. use [nvm.fish](https://github.com/jorgebucaran/nvm.fish) to install and run global pnpm in Nodejs v20 as pnpm@8 only support Nodejs v16 and above.
